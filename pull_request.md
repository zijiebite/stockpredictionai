Hi Boris,
   I find your work using GAN to predict Stock Market really fascinating.
   I am a undergraduate majoring CS & AI, and I'm truly interested in it, especially how you use ARIMA as an feature for further work.
   In fact, I am trying to predict a stock in my country recently, and I didn't even think of using GAN at all.
   So, would you be so kind as to share your full code, so that I can have an idea on how to do my work better.

Truly thanks
